You are given an integer array of unique positive integers nums. Consider the following graph:
There are nums.length nodes, labeled nums[0] to nums[nums.length - 1],
There is an undirected edge between nums[i] and nums[j] if nums[i] and nums[j] share a common factor greater than 1.
Return the size of the largest connected component in the graph.
  Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,6,15,35]
Output: 4
Example 2:
Input: nums = [20,50,9,63]
Output: 2
Example 3:
Input: nums = [2,3,6,7,4,12,21,39]
Output: 8
  Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
1 <= nums[i] <= 105
All the values of nums are unique.
