Given a string s, consider all duplicated substrings: (contiguous) substrings of s that occur 2 or more times. The occurrences may overlap.
Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible length. If s does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is "".
  Example 1:
Input: s = "banana"
Output: "ana"
Example 2:
Input: s = "abcd"
Output: ""
  Constraints:
2 <= s.length <= 3 * 104
s consists of lowercase English letters.
