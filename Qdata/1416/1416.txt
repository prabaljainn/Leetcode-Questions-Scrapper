Given an integer array sorted in non-decreasing order, there is exactly one integer in the array that occurs more than 25% of the time, return that integer.
  Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,2,6,6,6,6,7,10]
Output: 6
Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,1]
Output: 1
  Constraints:
1 <= arr.length <= 104
0 <= arr[i] <= 105
