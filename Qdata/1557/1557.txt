Given an integer n, return a binary string representing its representation in base -2.
Note that the returned string should not have leading zeros unless the string is "0".
  Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: "110"
Explantion: (-2)2 + (-2)1 = 2
Example 2:
Input: n = 3
Output: "111"
Explantion: (-2)2 + (-2)1 + (-2)0 = 3
Example 3:
Input: n = 4
Output: "100"
Explantion: (-2)2 = 4
  Constraints:
0 <= n <= 109
