We define the string base to be the infinite wraparound string of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", so base will look like this:
"...zabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcd....".
Given a string s, return the number of unique non-empty substrings of s are present in base.
  Example 1:
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
Explanation: Only the substring "a" of s is in base.
Example 2:
Input: s = "cac"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two substrings ("a", "c") of s in base.
Example 3:
Input: s = "zab"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are six substrings ("z", "a", "b", "za", "ab", and "zab") of s in base.
  Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of lowercase English letters.
