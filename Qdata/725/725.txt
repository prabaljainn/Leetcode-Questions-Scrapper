We want to split a group of n people (labeled from 1 to n) into two groups of any size. Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group.
Given the integer n and the array dislikes where dislikes[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that the person labeled ai does not like the person labeled bi, return true if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way.
  Example 1:
Input: n = 4, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: true
Explanation: The first group has [1,4], and the second group has [2,3].
Example 2:
Input: n = 3, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: false
Explanation: We need at least 3 groups to divide them. We cannot put them in two groups.
  Constraints:
1 <= n <= 2000
0 <= dislikes.length <= 104
dislikes[i].length == 2
1 <= ai < bi <= n
All the pairs of dislikes are unique.
