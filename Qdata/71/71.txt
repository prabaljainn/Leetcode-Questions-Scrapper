Given an integer n represented as a string, return the smallest good base of n.
We call k >= 2 a good base of n, if all digits of n base k are 1's.
  Example 1:
Input: n = "13"
Output: "3"
Explanation: 13 base 3 is 111.
Example 2:
Input: n = "4681"
Output: "8"
Explanation: 4681 base 8 is 11111.
Example 3:
Input: n = "1000000000000000000"
Output: "999999999999999999"
Explanation: 1000000000000000000 base 999999999999999999 is 11.
  Constraints:
n is an integer in the range [3, 1018].
n does not contain any leading zeros.
