You are given an integer array values where values[i] represents the value of the ith sightseeing spot. Two sightseeing spots i and j have a distance j - i between them.
The score of a pair (i < j) of sightseeing spots is values[i] + values[j] + i - j: the sum of the values of the sightseeing spots, minus the distance between them.
Return the maximum score of a pair of sightseeing spots.
  Example 1:
Input: values = [8,1,5,2,6]
Output: 11
Explanation: i = 0, j = 2, values[i] + values[j] + i - j = 8 + 5 + 0 - 2 = 11
Example 2:
Input: values = [1,2]
Output: 2
  Constraints:
2 <= values.length <= 5 * 104
1 <= values[i] <= 1000
