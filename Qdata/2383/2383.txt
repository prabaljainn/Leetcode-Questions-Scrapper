Given a string s, return the number of different non-empty palindromic subsequences in s. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
A subsequence of a string is obtained by deleting zero or more characters from the string.
A sequence is palindromic if it is equal to the sequence reversed.
Two sequences a1, a2, ... and b1, b2, ... are different if there is some i for which ai != bi.
  Example 1:
Input: s = "bccb"
Output: 6
Explanation: The 6 different non-empty palindromic subsequences are 'b', 'c', 'bb', 'cc', 'bcb', 'bccb'.
Note that 'bcb' is counted only once, even though it occurs twice.
Example 2:
Input: s = "abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcddcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcba"
Output: 104860361
Explanation: There are 3104860382 different non-empty palindromic subsequences, which is 104860361 modulo 109 + 7.
  Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 1000
s[i] is either 'a', 'b', 'c', or 'd'.
