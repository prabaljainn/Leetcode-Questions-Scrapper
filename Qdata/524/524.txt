A positive integer is magical if it is divisible by either a or b.
Given the three integers n, a, and b, return the nth magical number. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
  Example 1:
Input: n = 1, a = 2, b = 3
Output: 2
Example 2:
Input: n = 4, a = 2, b = 3
Output: 6
  Constraints:
1 <= n <= 109
2 <= a, b <= 4 * 104
