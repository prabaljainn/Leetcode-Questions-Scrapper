Given the radius and the position of the center of a circle, implement the function randPoint which generates a uniform random point inside the circle.
Implement the Solution class:
Solution(double radius, double x_center, double y_center) initializes the object with the radius of the circle radius and the position of the center (x_center, y_center).
randPoint() returns a random point inside the circle. A point on the circumference of the circle is considered to be in the circle. The answer is returned as an array [x, y].
  Example 1:
Input
["Solution", "randPoint", "randPoint", "randPoint"]
[[1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [], [], []]
Output
[null, [-0.02493, -0.38077], [0.82314, 0.38945], [0.36572, 0.17248]]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution(1.0, 0.0, 0.0);
solution.randPoint(); // return [-0.02493, -0.38077]
solution.randPoint(); // return [0.82314, 0.38945]
solution.randPoint(); // return [0.36572, 0.17248]
  Constraints:
0 < radius <= 108
-107 <= x_center, y_center <= 107
At most 3 * 104 calls will be made to randPoint.
