An n x n grid is composed of 1 x 1 squares where each 1 x 1 square consists of a '/', '\', or blank space ' '. These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.
Given the grid grid represented as a string array, return the number of regions.
Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a '\' is represented as '\\'.
  Example 1:
Input: grid = [" /","/ "]
Output: 2
Example 2:
Input: grid = [" /","  "]
Output: 1
Example 3:
Input: grid = ["/\\","\\/"]
Output: 5
Explanation: Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "\\/" refers to \/, and "/\\" refers to /\.
  Constraints:
n == grid.length == grid[i].length
1 <= n <= 30
grid[i][j] is either '/', '\', or ' '.
