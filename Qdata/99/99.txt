You are given an array of integers distance.
You start at the point (0, 0) on an X-Y plane, and you move distance[0] meters to the north, then distance[1] meters to the west, distance[2] meters to the south, distance[3] meters to the east, and so on. In other words, after each move, your direction changes counter-clockwise.
Return true if your path crosses itself or false if it does not.
  Example 1:
Input: distance = [2,1,1,2]
Output: true
Explanation: The path crosses itself at the point (0, 1).
Example 2:
Input: distance = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: The path does not cross itself at any point.
Example 3:
Input: distance = [1,1,1,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: The path crosses itself at the point (0, 0).
  Constraints:
1 <= distance.length <= 105
1 <= distance[i] <= 105
