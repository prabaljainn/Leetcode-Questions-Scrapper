Given a binary string s and a positive integer n, return true if the binary representation of all the integers in the range [1, n] are substrings of s, or false otherwise.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
  Example 1:
Input: s = "0110", n = 3
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: s = "0110", n = 4
Output: false
  Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 1000
s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
1 <= n <= 109
